<h4>DO YOU LOOK AFTER SOMEONE WHO IS ILL, FRAIL, DISABLED OR MENTALLY ILL?</h4>
<p>We are interested in identifying carers, especially those people who may be 
caring without help or support. We know that carers are often "hidden" looking after 
a family member or helping a friend or neighbour with day to day tasks and may 
not see themselves as a carer.</p>

<p>Caring for someone is an important and valuable role in the community, which 
is often a 24-hour job that can be very demanding and isolating for the carer. 
Carers should receive appropriate support by way of access to accurate information
 on a range of topics such as entitlement to benefits and respite care and not least,
 a listening ear when things get too much.</p>
<p>If you are a carer, please ask at Reception for a carers identification form
 so we can update our records.</p>
