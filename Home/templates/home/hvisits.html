<hr style="border:dotted 1px #C8C8C8">
<p> As of 31<sup>st</sup> March 2016, the NHS have issued the following:</p>
<p><strong>A patient safety alert has been issued by NHS England 
around the prioritisation of general practice home visits.</strong></p>

<p>When a request for a home visit is made, it is vital that general 
practices have a system in place to assess:</p>

<ul><li>whether a home visit is clinically necessary; and</ul></li>
<ul><li>the urgency of need for medical attention.</ul></li>

<p>This can be undertaken, for example, by telephoning the patient or 
carer in advance to gather information to allow for an informed 
decision to be made on prioritisation according to clinical need. 
In some cases the urgency of need will be so great that it will be 
inappropriate for the patient to wait for a GP home visit and 
alternative emergency care arrangements will be necessary.</p>

<p>It is recognised good practice for general practices to have 
systems in place to triage and prioritise home visits. The aim of 
this alert is to raise awareness of this good practice.

<h3><b>Our Policy</b></h3>
<p>If possible please try to telephone reception before 11.30am if 
you require a home visit.
House visits are  available for patients who are housebound because 
of illness or disability. The home visit will be carried out by the 
available doctor on the day.
whenever possible we prefer to see you at the surgery where we can 
be more thorough in our evaluation; if you do not feel well enough 
to sit in the waiting room we can make alternative arrangements.</p>
